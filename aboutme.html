  <p> I'm a 17 year old rising senior at the Bronx High School of Science. I enjoy reading and listening to music in my free time. I'm also very interested in pursuing a career in computer science.
  I grew up in the Bronx and have lived in the same building since birth.

  <p>I enjoy reading. One of my favorite books is The Heartbroken Heartbreaker.
  I also really love music. My favorite artists include Liam Payne, Alex Aiono, Zayn Malik, Conor Maynard, Harry Styles, Louis Tomlinson, Niall Horan, and One Republic.
  I like building and making crafts as well.
